Functions:
   G   Short to R for air handler fan on
   Y   Short to R for compressor (needs fan too) (if heat pump, this will be heat and cool depending on reversing valve)
   W   Short to R for heat (needs fan too) (might just be aux/emergency heat for use when defrosting)
   O   Short to R for heat pump cool (Activates reversing valve, and then with the compressor as well, it will cool)

   C   Common, 24vac constant. It'll be used with R for power.

   Notes: when using heat pump heat, reversing valve will need to be switched for a few minutes every two hours or so,
       More often the colder it gets, to defrost outside coils.

   Delay for 10 minutes on start before compressor can be run. If compressor is turned off, make it so it CANNOT
       turn back on before 10 minutes has elapsed

   relayBoardIn02 and relayBoardIn03 (CHECK THAT THESE ARE THE ACTUAL ONES) come on very briefly on board power.
       Use for fan call and emergency heat call since those will care the least about blips.

       You should only need to use 1. If this is the case, make 03 aux heat. 02 does stuff on program.

Can you switch the reversing valve while the compressor is running? Yes. Should you? Maybe not, but sounds like companies do it anyway.

Does the thermostat handle the defrost cycle or is it automatically handled by the outdoor unit? Outdoor handles.
